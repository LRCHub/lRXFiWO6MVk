Save - You've got to save your life today
Play - Why don't you play it your own way
They - Well they can say what they will
If you don't stand true no one will
Go - You've got the feelin' that it's gone away
Show - They show you idols made of clay
Now - We have to learn how to behave

You only learn this if you

Try to - Climb walls that surround you
Want to - Take all that you can do
Hope that - There might be another way
To find some sunshine after rain

Dawn - This is a new dawn everyone
Gun - We find ourselves under this gun
Chance - It looks like no second chance
Before we start the final dance
Tribe - We're every tribe under the sun
Gone - It's only over when we're gone
Run - We're only human nowhere to run

You only live if you
